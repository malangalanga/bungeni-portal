used by the developers to make quick notes. For formal tasks, use the

USER INTERFACE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Navigate away warning
---------------------

This was removed, but may be re-added (to js/behavior.js), e.g.

  $(window).unload(function () {
     alert("Bye now!");
  });

Response add/edit
-----------------

Make sure the question which is being responded to is shown.


PERMISSIONS/ROLES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding parliamentary content
----------------------------

No-one should be able to add parliamentary items to a "former"
parliament, whatever this means for the user interface.
