#summary How to update ore.yui package

= Introduction =

ore.yui is a Zope 3 packaging of YUI and is extensively used in Bungeni. The instructions below detail how to update the package with newer versions of YUI.


= Details =
  * Download ore.yui source.
{{{
svn checkout https://svn.objectrealms.net/svn/public/ore.yui/trunk .
}}}
  * edit rname and version variables at the top of setup.py to the version of YUI and the version number of the egg that you are creating respectively. 
  * create the egg. setup.py downloads the version of YUI specified above and unpacks it
{{{
python ./setup.py bdist_egg
}}}
  * due to a "bug" in setup_tools, the YUI resources will not be included if bdist or sdist commands are issued in the line above. This is explained in this [http://osdir.com/ml/python.distutils.devel/2007-02/msg00024.html thread]. To generate a source or binary distribution, a MANIFEST.in file must be created within the src folder with the following lines
{{{
include *.py *.zcml *.txt
recursive-include src/ore/yui/resources *.*
}}}
