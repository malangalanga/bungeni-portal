Bungeni language configuration is managed in this file:
{{{
{BUNGENI_INSTALL_PATH}/src/bungeni_custom/__init__.py. 
}}}
The location of this file may be different if you have a custom configuration location. (See [HowTo_CustomizeParlimentaryInformationManagement#Using_the_customization_folder Using the customization folder])

The parameters in the snippet below will be found in this file and determine how languages are handled in Bungeni and are discussed below.

{{{
# language ids, either as a space-separated string or as a list of strings
zope_i18n_allowed_languages = "ar en es es-do fr it nl pt ru sw tk" 

# boolean: True, False
zope_i18n_compile_mo_files = True 

# string, language identifier, must be one of zope_i18n_allowed_languages
default_language = "en"

# language ids for languages written right to left, as a space-separated string
right_to_left_languages = "ar" 
}}}

=== Setting the default language for the system ===
The system's default language can be set via the parameter *default_language* which is one of the language codes in the list *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*.
This language will be used in the Bungeni user interface if the user has not chosen another language from the language menu or the browser language is not one of *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*.

=== Enabling other languages ===
To enable or disable languages, add or remove language codes from the list *zope_i18n_allowed_languages*. 

Only enabled languages will show up in Bungeni's languages menu. With the settings above, this will be the the language menu:

=== Other language settings ===
The parameter *zope_i18n_compile_mo_files* determines if message catalogs are compiled to a binary format.

To specify the languages for which the user interface should be rendered right-to-left, add or remove languages from *right_to_left_languages*.
