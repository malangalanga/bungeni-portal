= Introduction =

This page documents typical problems in Bungeni - and suggests resolutions to these issues.

== Bungeni Starts up but unable to browse to the service ==

Bungeni can be browsed on port 8081 but the portal interface (8080) cannot be accessed even though the portal service is running -- 

* check the host and port entries in the deploy.ini file for the portal - If they are bound to a specific IP then you must browse Bungeni using that IP.


== PDF conversion does not work in Bungeni ==

PDF conversion does not work in Bungeni
 * Check if the OpenOffice service is started in the background : 
{{{
 $ps aux | grep soffice
 /usr/bin/soffice -accept=socket,port=2002;urp; -nologo -nofirststartwizard -headless
}}}

 * Check if supporting software for pdf conversion is installed - e.g libtidy :
{{{
sudo apt-get install libtidy-dev
}}}

 * PDF conversion will not work with custom installed openoffice installations -e.g. if you install the version of OOo from the openoffice.org website. You must use the Openoffice installation packaged with Ubuntu. 

== Locale Error on startup == 

If you get a error like this on startup : 

{{{
 File "/home/undesa/disk1/bungeni/cap_installs/python25/lib/python2.5/locale.py",
line 514, in getpreferredencoding
   setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")
 File "/home/undesa/disk1/bungeni/cap_installs/python25/lib/python2.5/locale.py",
line 478, in setlocale
   return _setlocale(category, locale)
Error: unsupported locale setting
}}}

You need to configure locales on your operating system. On Desktop installations of linux this comes configured out of the box ; this error is usually encountered on headless linux installations.

To resolve this problem, setup and configure a default locale :

{{{
sudo apt-get install language-pack-en
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
}}}
