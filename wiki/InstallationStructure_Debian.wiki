#summary Information related to debian package based installations

= Introduction =

Bungeni can also be installed using a set of Debian packages.
When installed via the debian package method - the installation is much faster as the debian packages include pre-built binaries, so there is no build process required using the typical installation method.

When the debian packages have been installed, the bungeni services can be started using the ubuntu service manager :

{{{
sudo service bungeni_services start
}}}

Which will start supervisor on port 8888 , and the user can browse to http://localhost:8888 to start / stop the bungeni services (default user / pass : admin / admin) .

The folder structure for deployment is :

{{{
/opt/bungeni
├── bungeni_apps
├── exec
}}}


The installation also creates a `bungeni` user who becomes the owner of the /opt/bungeni and its sub-folders.

*bungeni_apps* - all the software components are installed within this folder, the structure is exactly the same as a built from source Bungeni

*exec* - this folders contains the fabric scripts. You can access them by ssh-ing to localhost using the `bungeni` user.

For live deployments the `bungeni` user needs to be disabled to prevent security intrusions.
