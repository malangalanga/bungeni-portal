== Introduction == 

This page explains how to install the fabric installation scripts onto your computer.
The assumption here is that you have already [http://code.google.com/p/bungeni-portal/wiki/HowTo_InstallFabric installed fabric]

== Setup == 

Checkout the fabric scripts into a folder called `fabric` or any name of your choice

{{{
svn co http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/svn/capistrano/fabric ./fabric
}}}


== Configuring == 

Before starting a build using fabric -- configure your installation as per your requirements as described in [Understanding_Fabric_ini_Files Understanding Fabric ini files]

For example - 

 * if you wanted to install Bungeni in the `/home/undesa/testing` folder of your computer - and you wanted to install it as a development build, you would edit the following parameters in your  bungeni.ini file :
{{{
[global]
system_root = /home/undesa/testing
development_build = True
local_cache = False
app_host = localhost

[scm]
user=user.name
pass=svnpassword
}}}


 * If you did not want to install it in development mode : 
{{{
[global]
system_root = /home/undesa/testing
development_build = False
local_cache = False
app_host = localhost

[scm]
user=
pass=
}}}

 * If you had a linux distro with a non-standard list of required packages :
{{{
[global]
system_root = /home/undesa/testing
development_build = False
local_cache = False
app_host = localhost
distro_override = CustomDistro:Packages

[scm]
user=
pass=
}}}

and your distro.ini would look like this :

{{{
[CustomDistro]
Packages = 
	   package-zip-dev
	   package-jpeg-dev
	   ....
}}}
