= Pre-Requisites for Bungeni =

The Bungeni Application system has the following pre-requisites :
 * User installed Python 2.6 / 2.5
 * User installed Python 2.4
 * SSL, Imaging, bz2 extensions for Python 2.4 & 2.6 (or 2.5)
 * System libraries required for building  PostgreSQL from source
 * OpenOffice.org -- this is used for PDF conversion

Recommended Linux distribution :
 * Ubuntu 10.04 (32 or 64 bit distro)

The build process downloads various components from the internet - so it is *neccessary* for the computer to have access to the internet.

All of these pre-requisites can be automatically installed via a fabric setup script.

So, first we install Fabric - and run the pre-requisite setup scripts which installs all the required pre-requisites.


= Installing Fabric = 

You will need to first install Fabric.

See [HowTo_InstallFabric How to Install Fabric]

After installing Fabric, you will need to configure a few parameters to decide where you want to setup Bungeni.

See [HowTo_SetupFabricScripts How to setup the Bungeni Fabric Scripts] , also see [HowTo_ConfigureFabricIni How to configure the fabric setup.ini file]

= Install the pre-requisites = 

After setting up the Fabric scripts, you can install the pre-requisites using Fabric.

From the fabric folder run : 
{{{
fab -H <host-name-or-ip> presetup
}}}

or if you are installing it on `localhost` you can simply run :
{{{
./fl presetup
}}}
