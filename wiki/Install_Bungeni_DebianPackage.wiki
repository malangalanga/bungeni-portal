Install Bungeni using the Debian packaging system

Bungeni is available for installation as a debian package for Ubuntu 12.04 (32 bit and 64 bit) on the following link:

||Operating System || Download Link ||
|| Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit || [http://bungeni-portal.googlecode.com/files/bungeni_1.0+2012-10-01-1_i386.deb bungeni_1.0+2012-10-01-1_i386.deb]

= How to Install  = 

Once you have downloaded the package, right click on it in Nautilus and click "Open With" -> "GDebi Package manager".

The system will prompt you to enter your password, once you have entered that the installation will commence by installing the dependencies and then complete.

To install from the command line :
{{{
  sudo gdebi bungeni_1.0+XXXXXX.deb
}}}

If you need to install gdebi you can install it using :
{{{
 sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
}}}

*NOTE: We don't recommend installing using `apt-get install bungeni_1.0+XXXXXX.deb` since it doesn't install the dependencies.*

= Starting Bungeni = 

Once the installation is complete, you can start and stop Bungeni from the terminal window :

To start:
{{{
sudo service bungeni_services start
}}}

You can now launch the web browser and browse to `http://localhost:8888` - enter user name and password : admin / admin and then you can start access the different Bungeni services. The core Bungeni package only installs `bungeni` and `postgres`.

Once the `bungeni` and `postgres` service are started, browse to `http://localhost:8081` to access Bungeni.


To stop:
{{{
sudo service bungeni_services stop
}}}


= To Uninstall = 

You can uninstall using the package manager, by removing the `bungeni` package.

Or alternatively from the command line type :

{{{
sudo apt-get remove bungeni
}}}
