= Bungeni Source Code Style Guide =

Recommendations for Bungeni source code style, 
with the aim of enhancing source code *read*-ability, *grep*-ability and *print*-ability 
-- and, as a consequence, _understand_-ability, _debug_-ability, _test_-ability and _maintain_-ability.

However, if conforming to these source style recommendations 
reduces any of the above code qualities in any way then conformance 
*should not* be adhered to.


== Python ==

All Bungeni python source code should follow these style rules. 
For any styling issue not explicitly specified here,
[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code]
should be applied -- for this reason you may find the 
[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8/ pep8 checker tool] 
useful.

=== Quote characters ===

Prefer using single double-quote `"` instead of single-quote `'` characters.

Always use a single double-quote char `"` to delineate a short literal string. 
Only use single-quote `'` when the literal string itself contains *double-quote*
characters that would otherwise require explicit escaping. 

Always use triple double-quote chars `"""` to delineate a multi-line string.
Only use triple single-quotes `'''` when the literal string contains itself 
*triple double-quote* characters that would otherwise require explicit escaping. 

The use of triple single-quotes `'''` should be reserved only to 
*temporarily comment out* entire code sections.

For long string that should not include any additional whitespace as a result 
of pretty source formatting should use the auto-concatenation feature of 
adjacent strings e.g. (preferably):
{{{
    long_string = "some text as part of a sible line string " \
                  "more text for the same string "
}}}
or:
{{{
    long_string = ("some text as part of a sible line string "
                  "more text for the same string")
}}}
but not:
{{{
    long_string = ("some text as part of a sible line string " +
                  "more text for the same string")
}}}

==== Quoting _inlined source code_ strings ====

Always delineate with triple double-quote chars `"""` e.g.
{{{
        rdb.CheckConstraint("""active_p in ('A', 'I', 'D')"""),
}}}

=== Multi-line parameter lists, literal lists and obejcts ===

 * The closing parenthesis, brace or bracket should be directly below the beginning of the opening symbol. 
 * Only use multiple lines when a single line (of max 79 chars) is not sufficient.
 * Always inlcude the most _key_ of parameters on the opening line.

For example: 
{{{
    columns = [
        rdb.Column("version_id", rdb.Integer, primary_key=True),
        rdb.Column("content_id", rdb.Integer, rdb.ForeignKey(table.c[fk_id])),
        rdb.Column("change_id", rdb.Integer, 
            rdb.ForeignKey("%s_changes.change_id" % entity_name)
        ),
        rdb.Column("manual", rdb.Boolean, nullable=False, default=False),
    ]
}}}



=== Multiple forms for same -- adopt and use one ===

==== Comparison operators ====

Always use `!=` and not `<>` (that is equivalent). 



== XML/ZCML==

Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. 


=== Multi-line elements ===

Empty elements -- ended with `/>` -- are:
 * either on same single line as the opening tag
 * or at exacly same indent as opening tag
For example:
{{{
    <browser:menu id="reporting_actions"
        title="The 'Reports' menu - provides reporting actions"
        class="ploned.ui.menu.PloneBrowserMenu"
    />
}}}

When an element has a clear _key_ attribute -- 
i.e. the one most obvious attribute by which the element could be identified 
or grouped e.g. `id` or `name`, `menu` for `<menuItem>` elements, etc. 
-- it should be specified first and on same line as opening tag.
For example:
{{{
    <adapter factory=".workspace.WorkspaceContainerTraverser"
        permission="zope.Public"
        trusted="true"
    />
}}}


=== Naming === 

Workflow state/transition names:
 * State names should be lowercase _adjectives_.
 * Transition names should be lowercase _verbs_.
 * Note that given that all names are specified as XML @id attributes,
   state and transition names must be unique for the XML document.
 * All multiple word names are joined using an `_` (underscore) character.
