= Bungeni Source Code Style Guide =

Recommendations for Bungeni source code style, 
with the aim of enhancing source code *read*-ability, *grep*-ability and *print*-ability and consequently, _understand_-ability, _debug_-ability, _test_-ability, _maintain_-ability, etc.

However, if conforming to these source style recommendations 
reduces any of the above code qualities in any way then conformance 
*should not* be adhered to -- use your good judgement instead.

----

== General - All Formats ==

Applies to all project source code, irrespective of format e.g.
`.py`, `.xml`, `.zcml`, `.js`, `.css`, etc. 

=== Quote characters ===

Prefer the double-quote `"` instead of the single-quote `'` character, whenever you have the choice.


=== _Revisit_ Comments ===

Use _Revisit_ comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution to be reworked, or for code on which there is still questions to be resolved or understood.

A _Revisit_ comments should have a: 
 * `!+` : must explicitly start with these 2 characters
 * _label_ : for easier grepping, and to be able to relate multiple comments in different places (by giving them the same label)
 * _author identifier_ : so others know who to follow-up with if needed
 * _date_ : so it is easier to judge relevance and status at a later time
 * _description_ : should also indicate what conditions/events would render the comment obsolete.
 
Authoring a _revisit_ comment is *not* a commitment to revisit it yourself. 

These pieces of information should be formatted in the following way:
{{{
    !+LABEL(author, date) description...
}}}
And should be specified in a comment as per the source format i.e. any of python, XML, doctest text files, HTML templates, css, js, etc. 

As example, here are 2 related _revisit_ comments in different ZCML files:

`models/configure.zcml`
{{{
<!-- !+CONSTITUENCY-Issue666(mr, 23-Jul-2010)
why is the include="domain.zcml" above commented?
-->
}}}
`models/permissions.zcml`
{{{
<!-- !+CONSTITUENCY-Issue666(mr, 23-Jul-2010)
The grant below is a temporary workaround to the problem that,
when NOT logged in, clicking on a consituency (below archive/ )
to view it would result in the following error:

<class 'zope.security.interfaces.Unauthorized'>:
(<zope.app.publisher.browser.viewmeta.DisplayForm object at 0xb717c8c>, 'browserDefault', 'zope.View')

For some reason, this is not needed for any other object -:- this should
be removed when it is understood why bungeni.Anybody does not get
zope.View on domain.Constituency type, as for other anonymously visible
domain types.
-->
<grant permission="bungeni.constituency.View" role="bungeni.Anybody" />
}}}


=== Naming ===

==== Workflow States and Transitions ====

Workflow state/transition names:
 * State names should be lowercase _adjectives_.
 * Transition names should be lowercase _verbs_.
 * Given that each workflow is specified in an XML file, and the state and transition names specified as values of an `id` attribute in that same file, state and transition names must be unique for the XML file -- in other words, a state and a transaition may not have the same name.
 * All multiple word names are joined using an `_` (underscore) character.

----

== Python ==

All Bungeni python source code should follow these style rules. 

For any styling issue not explicitly specified here, heed the recommendations 
of the following Python Style Guides: 

 * [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code]<br/>Regarding this one you may find the following tools useful:

   * [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html#Comments Comments]

=== Quote characters ===

Always use a single double-quote char `"` to delineate a short literal string. 
Only use single-quote `'` when the literal string itself contains *double-quote*
characters that would otherwise require explicit escaping. 

Always use triple double-quote chars `"""` to delineate a multi-line string.
Only use triple single-quotes `'''` when the literal string contains itself 
*triple double-quote* characters that would otherwise require explicit escaping. 

The use of triple single-quotes `'''` should be reserved only to 
*temporarily comment out* entire code sections.

For long string that should not include any additional whitespace as a result 
of pretty source formatting should use the auto-concatenation feature of 
adjacent strings e.g. (preferably):
{{{
    long_string = "some text as part of a sible line string " \
                  "more text for the same string "
}}}
or:
{{{
    long_string = ("some text as part of a sible line string "
                   "more text for the same string")
}}}
but not:
{{{
    long_string = ("some text as part of a sible line string " +
                   "more text for the same string")
}}}

==== Quoting _inlined source code_ strings ====

Always delineate embedded code with triple double-quote chars `"""` -- even if the string is not multi-line. Example, here's a snippet of inlined SQL:
{{{
        rdb.CheckConstraint("""active_p in ('A', 'I', 'D')"""),
}}}

=== Multi-line parameter lists, literal lists and objects ===

 * The closing parenthesis, brace or bracket should be directly below the beginning of the opening symbol.
 * Continuation lines should be indented as per their nesting level i.e. 4 spaces per open _parenthesis_, _braces_, _brackets_, or any _block_ implied by any other way.
 * Only use multiple lines when a single line (of max 79 chars) is not sufficient.
 * Always include the most _key_ of parameters on the opening line.

Some examples: 
{{{
    columns = [
        rdb.Column("version_id", rdb.Integer, primary_key=True),
        rdb.Column("content_id", rdb.Integer, rdb.ForeignKey(table.c[fk_id])),
        rdb.Column("change_id", rdb.Integer, 
            rdb.ForeignKey("%s_changes.change_id" % entity_name)
        ),
        rdb.Column("manual", rdb.Boolean, nullable=False, default=False),
    ]
}}}

{{{
mapper(domain.User, schema.users,
    properties={"user_addresses": relation(domain.UserAddress)}
)
}}}

{{{
mapper(domain.GroupSitting, schema.sittings,
    properties={
        "sitting_type": relation(domain.SittingType, uselist=False),
        "group": relation(domain.Group,
            primaryjoin=schema.sittings.c.group_id == schema.groups.c.group_id,
            uselist=False,
            lazy=True
        ),
        "start_date": column_property(
            schema.sittings.c.start_date.label("start_date")
        ),
        "end_date": column_property(
            schema.sittings.c.end_date.label("end_date")),
        "item_schedule": relation(domain.ItemSchedule,
            order_by=schema.items_schedule.c.planned_order),
        "venue": relation(domain.Venue)
    }
)
}}}

=== Multiple forms for same -- adopt and use one ===

==== Comparison operators ====

Always use `!=` and not `<>` (that is equivalent). 

----

== XML / ZCML ==

Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters. 

No blank lines -- only use a single blank line between elements on the uncommon occasion when those elements are completely unrelated to each other.


=== Multi-line elements ===

Empty XML elements should have the `/>` ending:
 * either on same single line as the opening tag
 * or at exactly same indent as opening tag
For example:
{{{
    <browser:menu id="admin_navigation" title="Actions Admin" />
    <browser:menuItem menu="admin_navigation"
        for="bungeni.models.interfaces.IBungeniApplication"
        title="Application Settings"
        action="settings"
        layer=".interfaces.IAdministratorWorkspace"
        permission="zope.ManageSite"
    />
}}}

When an element has a clear _key_ attribute -- 
i.e. the one most obvious attribute by which the element could be identified 
or grouped e.g. the `id` or `name` attribute, the `menu` attribute 
for `<menuItem>` elements, etc. -- 
it should be specified first and on same line as opening tag.
For example:
{{{
    <adapter factory=".workspace.WorkspaceContainerTraverser"
        permission="zope.Public"
        trusted="true"
    />
}}}

formatting multi-line pre-block statements e.g:

            if (IChoice.providedBy(field) and field.required and
                field.default is None
                ):

style for multi-line def paremeter declarations
