Introduction
============
The Products.workspaces product adds collaborative functionality to the system.

Members
-------

All members of the system get an individual workspace. Workspaces are titled
using the members username. All workspaces have a "Private Folder". Some
workspaces may have a "Web Pages" folder. Where this exists it is accessible
by the public and as such content stored in this folder that is not for public
viewing must be set to the  "Private" state.

Groups
------
All activated groups in the system get a shared workspace where members of the
groups can collaborate.
