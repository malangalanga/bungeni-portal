<!-- XXX-INFO-FOR-PLONE - MR - 2010-05-03

Review (original intention) and replace/remove with a more appropriate 
and clear implementation.

Apparently the reason for this (and user_id.pt) is simply to be able to pass 
to plone the group-id and the user-id! Many problems:
- no need to create (expensive) UI widgets to simply pass a piece of data along
- the form is invalid HTML (no action, etc)
- there is no explanations/comments as to why the whole thing is here in the first place
- inlined CSS to NOT display the output of this form (and no comments as to why)
- etc.

In addition, given that plone is currently disabled these vielwets/templatre 
are actually NOT being used anyway (but the need they are trying to address 
will still be needed in the future). 

So, I am commenting out all code relating to this. To be able to find the 
bits and pieces of code being commented out in teh future, I am "grep-tagging"
every change due to tthis with "XXX-INFO-FOR-PLONE".


<form id="workgroup-id-section" style="display: none;">
  <input
     type="text"
     id="workgroup-id"
     name="Workspace"
     tal:attributes="value string:groups/${view/parent_group_principal_id}/${view/my_group_principal_id}"/>
</form>
