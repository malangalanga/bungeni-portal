Bungeni calendar
================

The calendaring facilities in the Bungeni portal are used to schedule
events in the context of a parliamentary items.

An event is a composite of an item scheduling and a group sitting. The
former details the item of interest and in which order it appears
within the sitting. The sitting details the start- and end date of the
event as well as the attendence.

Context
-------

The calendar is shown in either a global context or in the context of
a particular principal group.

To this extend, the traversed context is adapted to
``ISchedulingContext`` which offers an interface from which we may
retrieve scheduled sittings and items.

This is motivated by the fact that in the global context, events
should be scheduled for the plenary while we may navigate to items
which provide their own scheduling context (e.g. committees).
