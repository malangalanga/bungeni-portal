"""Workflow transition-to-state actions.

Signature of all transition-to-state action callables:

    (context:Object) -> None

All transition-to-state actions are executed "on workflow trransition" i.e. 
exactly when the status is updated from the source to the destination state, 
and in exactly the order they are specified in the state.@actions xml attribute.

REMEMBER: when a transition-to-state action is executed, the context.status 
is already updated to the destination state.
