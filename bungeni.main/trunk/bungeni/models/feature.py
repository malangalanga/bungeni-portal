"""The Bungeni Application - Feature handling for domain models

Features (as per a deployment's configuration) - decorators for domain types
to support a "feature", to collect in one place all that is needed for the 
domain type to support that "feature".
 
The quality of a domain type to support a specific feature is externalized 
to localization and its implementation must thus be completely isolated, 
depending only on that one declaration.
