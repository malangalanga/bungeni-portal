"""The Bungeni Application - Feature handling for domain models

IFeature marker interfaces -- apply to a domain model, to declare that it 
implements the feature. To avoid "english language anomalies of derived names" 
e.g "schedule" -> ISchedulable, adopt a very KISS feature->interface naming 
convention: "schedule"->IFeatureSchedule
